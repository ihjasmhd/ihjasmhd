## Hi there 👋
Hello, I’m Ihjas—Indian national, Dubai resident for now, lifelong fan of tidy datasets. With a Master’s in Computer Applications and hands-on work at Imarticus Learning, I have:  

• Blended SQL queries with Python scripts to prepare high-quality data  

• Explored patterns through EDA, finding issues before they hurt KPIs  

• Shared findings through visuals managers can grasp in minutes  

• Cut manual reporting by automating data pipelines    


Key skills  

🔹 Languages: Python, R  

🔹 Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Excel, Power BI, Tableau  

🔹 Databases: MySQL, SQL Server 

🔹 Soft bits: listening first, clear talk, good time sense  

Favourite side projects show my curious streak: Pizza Sales Report, identifying crop diseases estimating age & gender from images, spotting PCOD risk factors—each taught me to mix tech with real-world needs.  

I enjoy cross-functional settings—sitting with sales, ops, finance—because patterns matter only when someone can act on them. I’m looking for analyst or BI roles in energy, logistics or commercial teams that value steady, reliable insight over flashy reports.
